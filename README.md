# Election-Analysis
with Python 3.7.6 and VS Code 1.58.0

## Overview of Election Audit
An audit was conducted to determine election results in a Colorado district. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to generate a vote count report to certify the election results.
#### Data: 
Data was collected using three primary voting methods:
- Mail-in Ballots - hand counted at the central office.
- Punch Cards - collected and fed into a machine that tabulates both totals and sends results to the central office.
- Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Machines - memory cards from the DRE machines are sent to the central office and red by a computer.

All data was collected in an 11K KB Excel CVS file with 369,711 ballot results.

#### Computer Language: 
Python programming language was used. For more information about Python, visit https://www.python.org/about/. Python files were executived in both a text editor (VS Code) and from the command line. VS Code was used to catch syntax errors while writing and debugging the script.

## Election Audit Results: 
Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

<!-- - How many votes were cast in this congressional election? Total number of votes cast:? A complete list of candidates who received votes? Total number of votes each candidate received? Percentage of votes each candidate won? The winner of the election based on popular vote?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
